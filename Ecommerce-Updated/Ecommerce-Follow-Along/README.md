## Key Code Highlights

### Password Visibility Toggle
The password visibility toggle is implemented using React's `useState` hook:
```javascript
const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useState(false);
```

A dynamic icon toggles between the **Eye** and **Eye Slash** states:
```jsx
<div
  onClick={() => setShowPassword(!showPassword)}
  className="absolute inset-y-0 right-0 flex items-center pr-3 text-white hover:text-gray-300 cursor-pointer"
>
  {showPassword ? (
    <EyeIcon className="h-5 w-5" />
  ) : (
    <EyeSlashIcon className="h-5 w-5" />
  )}
</div>
```
